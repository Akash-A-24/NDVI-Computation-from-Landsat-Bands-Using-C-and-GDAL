# NDVI-Computation-from-Landsat-Bands-Using-C-and-GDAL
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using Landsat Red (Band 4) and Near-Infrared (NIR, Band 5) imagery. The code uses the GDAL library to read raster data, extract pixel values from each band, compute NDVI for a 100×100 pixel subset, and export the results as a GeoTIFF NDVI image while preserving georeferencing metadata.
